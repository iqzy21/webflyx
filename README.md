Webflyx
This project was created while I was learning the fundamentals of Git. It serves as a practical exercise to understand and apply core Git concepts, including:

Setup & Config: How to initialize and configure repositories.
Branching & Merging: Creating branches for development and merging them.
Rebasing: Rewriting commit history to maintain a clean project history.
Reset: Undoing or modifying changes.
Remote: Using GitHub as a remote repository.
.gitignore: Managing ignored files to keep the repository clean.
This repository contains a variety of files, including markdown files for literary titles and quotes, as well as CSVs, all designed to showcase my understanding of these Git concepts.

Key Features
Branching: Created multiple branches to test feature addition (e.g., add_classics).
Merging & Rebasing: Merged and rebased branches to maintain a linear commit history.
.gitignore: Used .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files (like advert.html).
