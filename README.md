# Webflyx

This project was created as part of my journey to learn the fundamentals of Git and version control. It includes a collection of text files and CSVs to practice branch management, commits, merges, and file tracking.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **Setup & Config**: Learned how to initialize and configure Git repositories.
- **Branching & Merging**: Created branches to add features and merged them into the main branch.
- **Rebasing**: Used rebasing to maintain a clean, linear commit history.
- **Reset**: Practiced undoing changes and resetting commits.
- **Remote**: Pushed local changes to a remote repository on GitHub.
- **.gitignore**: Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.

## Project Features

- **Branching**: Created multiple branches (e.g., `add_classics`) to test feature development.
- **Merging & Rebasing**: Successfully merged branches and rebased commits to maintain project history.
- **.gitignore**: Excluded files like `advert.html` to keep the repository clean.
